		<h1>The Stalker</h1>
		<div class="Description">
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The <strong>Stalker</strong> is a fast-moving, ranged Protoss ground unit, capable of hitting both air and ground targets. They are warped in at the <strong>Gateway</strong>, and require a <strong>Cybernetics Core</strong>.
		
				The <strong>Stalker's</strong> name is indicative of its hit-and-run capabilities: they have a relatively high 	movement speed, and after the <strong>Blink</strong> upgrade has been researched at the Twilight Council, they can advance or retreat literally in a flash, bypassing rocks and hopping up and down cliffs.</p>
